Final has three uses: final variables are constants (cannot reassign), final methods cannot be overridden, final classes cannot be extended. Convention: CONSTANT_NAME for final variables. Final parameters cannot be modified in method. Improves security and clarity. Example: final double PI = 3.14159.
