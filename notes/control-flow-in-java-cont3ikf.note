Control flow manages execution order: if/else for decisions, switch for multiple conditions, for loops for known iterations, while for unknown iterations, do-while for at least one execution. Break exits loops, continue skips iteration. Enhanced for-loop: for(String s : array). Nested loops iterate within loops. Understanding flow control is essential for logic.
